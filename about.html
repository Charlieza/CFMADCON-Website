			<h1 class="editable">Our Story</h1>
			<p class="subtext editable">
				Established in <strong>2022</strong>, CFM Advisory & Consulting was born at the crossroads of <strong>tax expertise</strong> and <strong>astronomical insight</strong>.
				Founded by a tax specialist and an astronomer, our firm brings together two disciplines that rarely intersect — but offer immense power when they do.
				Where tax regulation demands structure and compliance, astronomy brings systems thinking, data fluency, and a long-term perspective.
			</p>
			<p class="subtext editable">
				We launched CFMADCON to help individuals, businesses, and institutions move from reactive compliance to proactive, data-informed leadership.
				In an era defined by digital transformation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), it’s not enough to stay legal — you must stay future-ready.
			</p>
			<p class="subtext editable">
				At our core, we believe tax is more than obligation — it’s an opportunity. Data is more than numbers — it’s intelligence. And development isn’t just a goal — it’s a measurable journey.
				We proudly serve changemakers, professionals, and mission-aligned institutions who know that <strong>smart compliance and scientific thinking are a powerful combination</strong>.
